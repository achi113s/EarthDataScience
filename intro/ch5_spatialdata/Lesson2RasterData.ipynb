    "Raster or \"gridded\" data are stores as a grid of values which are rendered on a map as pixels. Each pixel value represents an area on the Earth's surface making the data \"spatial.\" All of the cells in the grid are the same size.\n",

    "\n",
    "Raster data can be composed of one or more layers. For example, a raster file detailing elevation will often have just one layer representing the elevation of the Earth's surface for a particular location. However, other data including images and time series data may result in a raster file with multiple layers.\n",

    "### There Are Many Different Raster File Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster data can be stored in a single file. Some datasets such as landsat (a U.S. scientific satellite that studies and photographs the earth's surface by using remote-sensing techniques) and NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) are stored in single files. For landsat, often each band will be stored as a separate \\*.tif file. NAIP stores all bands in one \\*.tif file though:\n",

    "\n",
    "Rasters can also be stored in hierarchical data formats. These formats are optimal for larger data sets where we may want to subset or only work with parts of the data at one time. Hierarchical data can be a bit more involved to work with but they tend to make processing more efficient.\n",
